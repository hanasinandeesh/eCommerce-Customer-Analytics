# eCommerce Customer Analytics & Predictive Modeling

## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to the **eCommerce Customer Analytics & Predictive Modeling** project! This project leverages advanced data science techniques to perform deep analysis and generate actionable insights from a real-world eCommerce transactions dataset.

The goal is to:
- **Understand customer behavior** and **product performance** through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- **Identify similar customers** using a Lookalike Model to enhance marketing and sales efforts.
- **Segment customers** into meaningful clusters based on their transaction patterns and profiles.

This project is designed to help businesses optimize their marketing strategy, enhance customer engagement, and increase sales through predictive insights.

## üìä Key Deliverables

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Dive deep into the dataset and uncover valuable business insights. Our EDA will:
- Provide descriptive statistics and visualize key trends.
- Highlight patterns related to **customer transactions**, **product performance**, and **regional sales**.
- Derive **5 actionable business insights** to inform decision-making.

**Key Insights:**
- Who are the highest-value customers?
- What regions contribute the most to sales?
- How do product pricing strategies impact sales?

### 2. **Lookalike Model**
This model helps to:
- Find **3 most similar customers** for each of the first 20 customers based on their profile and transaction history.
- Deliver a **similarity score** to assess the closeness of each match.

**Real-World Application**: Target your marketing campaigns by reaching out to customers similar to your top performers.

### 3. **Customer Segmentation / Clustering**
We use **advanced clustering algorithms** to segment customers based on:
- Their **transaction behavior**.
- Their **profile information**.

By applying **K-means clustering**, we group customers into clusters, providing:
- Clear insights into customer **behavior types**.
- A measure of **cluster quality** through the **Davies-Bouldin index**.
- Visual representations of the clusters to aid decision-making.

**Impact**: Better customer targeting, personalized offers, and enhanced customer retention strategies.
